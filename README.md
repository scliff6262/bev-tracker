# BevTracker

Welcome to BevTracker. This basic Sinatra application will be used by "drink-enthusiasts" to keep a journal of the various beers, wines, cocktails, and spirits they may encounter. Each user will be able to maintain a profile that will display the different entries the user has made into the BevTracker, in chronological order.

In addition, upon signing up, each user will have the option to create either a public or private profile. A private user can enjoy simply documenting their beverage-experiences, while a public user's profile can be viewed by all other users, and their own entries will appear on the BevFeed. The BevFeed will show the last 10 BevTracker entries, by only public users.

## Installation

First be sure to have Ruby installed. Then download this repository, change directory to bev-tracker, and install the gems using 'bundle'.

To run the app locally, make sure Shotgun is installed (which should have occurred after 'bundle'). Use the 'shotgun' command and use the resulting route in your web browser.
